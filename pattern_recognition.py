"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   One synthetic image was successfully loaded from the specified directory.
*   The single loaded image was preprocessed by resizing it to 64x64 pixels, converting it to grayscale, and normalizing its pixel values.
*   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to extract features. Due to having only one image, PCA was performed with only one component, resulting in a single extracted feature value.
*   The extracted feature value for the single image was determined to be 0.0.
*   The result of the pattern recognition process, which is the single extracted feature value, was visualized using a bar plot and printed.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   With only a single image available, comprehensive pattern recognition is limited. To identify meaningful patterns, a dataset with multiple images exhibiting variations is required.
*   Future steps should involve acquiring or generating a larger dataset of synthetic images with diverse patterns to enable the application of more robust pattern recognition techniques and derive more significant insights.
